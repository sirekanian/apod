# Astronomy Picture of the Day

This repository contains pictures from https://apod.nasa.gov optimized for thumbnails.

Thumbnails are updated using the shell script [`apod.sh`](apod.sh). The script
uses [apod-api](https://github.com/nasa/apod-api) to get images and [imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org) to
optimize them.

## How to use

For using thumbnails replace the host of the original image from `apod.nasa.gov` to `sirekanian.com`.

For example if you have an image with url:<br>
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2303/JupiterVenus_Luy_960.jpg

The thumbnail url will look like this:<br>
https://sirekanian.com/apod/image/2303/JupiterVenus_Luy_960.jpg

## Jupiter and Venus Converge over Germany

_Explanation: This was a sky to show the kids. Early this month the two brightest planets in the night sky, Jupiter and Venus, appeared to converge. At their closest, the two planets were separated by only about the angular width of the full moon. The spectacle occurred just after sunset and was seen and photographed all across planet Earth. The displayed image was taken near to the time of closest approach from Wiltingen, Germany, and features the astrophotographer, spouse, and their two children.  Of course, Venus remains much closer to both the Sun and the Earth than Jupiter -- the apparent closeness between the planets in the sky of Earth was only angular.  Jupiter and Venus have passed and now appear increasingly far apart. Similar planetary convergence opportunities will eventually arise.  In a few months, for example, Mars and Venus will appear to congregate just as the Sun sets.   Jupiter {{explanation}} Venus Conjunction Gallery: Notable Submissions to APOD_
