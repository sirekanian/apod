# Astronomy Picture of the Day

This repository contains pictures from https://apod.nasa.gov optimized for thumbnails.

Thumbnails are updated using the shell script [`apod.sh`](apod.sh). The script
uses [apod-api](https://github.com/nasa/apod-api) to get images and [imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org) to
optimize them.

## How to use

For using thumbnails replace the host of the original image from `apod.nasa.gov` to `sirekanian.com`.

For example if you have an image with url:<br>
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2302/ABELL1060_LRGB_NASA_1024.jpg

The thumbnail url will look like this:<br>
https://sirekanian.com/apod/image/2302/ABELL1060_LRGB_NASA_1024.jpg

## The Hydra Cluster of Galaxies

_Explanation: Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered weak and weary, O'er volumes of astronomy and forgotten lore, I stumbled upon this snapshot, cosmic and eerie, A sight that filled my heart with awe and more. Two stars, like sentinels, anchored the foreground, Of our Milky Way galaxy, a sight to behold, Beyond them, a cluster of Hydra, galaxies abound, 100 million light-years away, a story to be told. Three large galaxies, ellipticals and a spiral blue, Dominant and grand, each 150,000 light-years wide, But it was the overlapping pair that caught my view, Cataloged as NGC 3314, a sight I cannot hide. Abell 1060, the Hydra galaxy cluster's name, One of three large galaxy clusters close to our Milky Way, A universe bound by gravity, a celestial game, Where clusters align over larger scales, I cannot sway. At a distance of 100 million light-years, this snapshot's size, 1.3 million light-years across, a cosmic delight, A momentary glimpse into the universe's guise, But even this shall fade, and be nevermore in sight._
