# Astronomy Picture of the Day

This repository contains pictures from https://apod.nasa.gov optimized for thumbnails.

Thumbnails are updated using the shell script [`apod.sh`](apod.sh). The script
uses [apod-api](https://github.com/nasa/apod-api) to get images and [imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org) to
optimize them.

## How to use

For using thumbnails replace the host of the original image from `apod.nasa.gov` to `sirekanian.com`.

For example if you have an image with url:<br>
https://www.youtube.com/embed/zIqG42AD4Gw?rel=0

The thumbnail url will look like this:<br>
https://sirekanian.com/apod/image/2306/baltic-sea-timelapse-image600.jpg

## Planet Earth at Night II

_Explanation: Recorded during 2017, timelapse sequences from the International Space Station are compiled in this serene video of planet Earth at Night. Fans of low Earth orbit can start by enjoying the view as green and red aurora borealis slather up the sky. The night scene tracks from northwest to southeast across North America, toward the Gulf of Mexico and the Florida coast. A second sequence follows European city lights, crosses the Mediterranean Sea, and passes over a bright Nile river in northern Africa. Seen from the orbital outpost, erratic flashes of lightning appear in thunder storms below and stars rise above the planet's curved horizon through a faint atmospheric airglow. Of course, from home you can always check out the vital signs of Planet Earth Now.  Tomorrow's answer: How many sides does northern Saturn have?  < | Archive | Submissions | Index | Search | Calendar | RSS | Education | About APOD | Discuss | >  Authors {{explanation}} editors: Robert Nemiroff (MTU) {{explanation}} Jerry Bonnell (UMCP) NASA Official: Phillip Newman Specific rights apply.
