# Astronomy Picture of the Day

This repository contains pictures from https://apod.nasa.gov optimized for thumbnails.

Thumbnails are updated using the shell script [`apod.sh`](apod.sh). The script
uses [apod-api](https://github.com/nasa/apod-api) to get images and [imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org) to
optimize them.

## How to use

For using thumbnails replace the host of the original image from `apod.nasa.gov` to `sirekanian.com`.

For example if you have an image with url:<br>
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2211/LunarEclipseRyanHan1024.jpg

The thumbnail url will look like this:<br>
https://sirekanian.com/apod/image/2211/LunarEclipseRyanHan1024.jpg

## Blood Moon, Ice Giant

_Explanation: On November 8 the Full Moon turned blood red as it slid through Earth's shadow in a beautiful total lunar eclipse. During totality it also passed in front of, or occulted, outer planet Uranus for eclipse viewers located in parts of northern America and Asia. For a close-up and wider view these two images were taken just before the occultation began, captured with different telescopes and cameras from the same roof top in Shanghai, China. Normally very faint compared to a Full Moon, the tiny, pale, greenish disk of the distant ice giant is just to the left of the Moon's edge and about to disappear behind the darkened, red lunar limb. Though only visible from certain locations across planet Earth, lunar occultations of planets are fairly common. But for this rare "lunar eclipse occultation" to take place, at the time of the total eclipse the outer planet had to be both at opposition and very near the ecliptic plane to fall in line with Sun, Earth, and Moon.
