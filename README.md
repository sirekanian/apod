# Astronomy Picture of the Day

This repository contains pictures from https://apod.nasa.gov optimized for thumbnails.

Thumbnails are updated using the shell script [`apod.sh`](apod.sh). The script
uses [apod-api](https://github.com/nasa/apod-api) to get images and [imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org) to
optimize them.

## How to use

For using thumbnails replace the host of the original image from `apod.nasa.gov` to `sirekanian.com`.

For example if you have an image with url:<br>
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2210/2T2A3056_1024.jpg

The thumbnail url will look like this:<br>
https://sirekanian.com/apod/image/2210/2T2A3056_1024.jpg

## The Falcon and the Hunter's Moon

_Explanation: The Full Moon of October 9th was the second Full Moon after the northern hemisphere autumnal equinox, traditionally called the Hunter's Moon. According to lore, the name is a fitting one because this Full Moon lights the night during a time for hunting in preparation for the coming winter months. In this snapshot, a nearly full Hunter's Moon was captured just after sunset on October 8, rising in skies over Florida's Space Coast. Rising from planet Earth a Falcon 9 rocket pierces the bright lunar disk from the photographer's vantage point. Ripples and fringes along the edge of the lunar disk appear as supersonic shock waves generated by the rocket's passage change the atmosphere's index of refraction._
