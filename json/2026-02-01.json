    "explanation": "Mars has put on a happy face.  The Martian crater Galle is famous because it has internal markings that make it look like a face that is both smiling and winking.  These markings were originally discovered in the 1970s in pictures taken by the Viking Orbiter.  The Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft that orbited Mars from 1996 to 2006 captured the featured picture.  Happy Face Crater and its iconic features were formed by chance billions of years ago when a city-sized asteroid slammed into the Martian surface.  All rocky planets and moons in our Solar System show impact craters, with the highest number of craters found on Earth's Moon and the planet Mercury. Earth and Venus would show the most, though, were it not for weather and erosion.   Sky Surprise: What picture did APOD feature on your birthday? (after 1995)",

    "explanation": "What part of Orion is this? Just north of the famous Orion Nebula is a picturesque star forming region in Orion's Sword that contains a lot of intricate dust -- some of which appears blue because it reflects the light of bright embedded stars.  The region's popular name is the Running Man Nebula because, looked at from the right, part of the brown dust appears to be running legs.  Cataloged as Sharpless 279, the reflection nebula is not only part of the constellation of Orion, but part of the greater Orion molecular cloud complex.  Light from the Running Man's bright stars, including 42 Orionis, the bright star closest to the featured image center, is slowly destroying and reshaping the surrounding dust, which will likely be completely gone in about 10 million years.  The nebula spans about 15 light years and lies about 1,500 light years away.   Jigsaw Nebula: Astronomy Puzzle of the Day",
