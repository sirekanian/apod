Formed about 200 million years ago, the present day terrain supports a 70-kilometer diameter hydroelectric reservoir in the telltale form of an annular lake.  The crater itself has been worn away by the passing of glaciers and other erosional processes. Still, the hard rock at the impact site has preserved much of the complex impact structure and so allows scientists a leading case to help understand  large impact features on Earth and other Solar System bodies.  Also visible above is the vertical fin of the Space Shuttle Columbia from which the picture was taken in 1983.",

Drawn above, however, is a good guess based on many different types of observations.  In the Milky Way's center is a very bright core region centered on a large black hole.  The Milky Way's bright central bulge is now thought to be an asymmetrical bar of relatively old and red stars.  The outer regions are where the spiral arms are found, dominated in appearance by open clusters of young, bright, blue stars, by red emission nebula, and by dark dust.  The spiral arms reside in a disk dominated in mass by relatively dim stars and loose gas composed mostly of hydrogen.

But the diffuse cloud of x-rays surrounding them is a bit mysterious. The image is color coded by x-ray energy, with high energies in blue, medium in green, and low energy x-rays in red. Just a few light-years across, the cloud which pervades the cluster has colors suggesting the x-rays are produced by high energy electrons moving through magnetic fields. Yet a source of energetic electrons, such as shockwaves from exploding stars (supernova remnants), or rotating neutron stars (pulsars), is not apparent in the Chandra data.

Both the riverbed and lakebed were thought to be dry at the time the image was taken but contained a flowing liquid - likely methane - in the recent past.  Titan's surface was found to appear strangely similar to Earth even though it is so cold that methane flows and water freezes into rock-hard ice.  Although the Huygens probe has now run out of power, the images it returned will likely be studied for decades to come.  The Cassini mothership is scheduled to continue to orbit Saturn and return images for several more years.",

    "explanation": "Why is this galaxy so active?  Nearby spiral galaxy NGC 6946 is undergoing a tremendous burst of star formation with no obvious cause.  In many cases spirals light up when interacting with another galaxy, but NGC 6946 appears relatively isolated in space.  Located just 10 million light years away toward the constellation of Cepheus, this beautiful face-on spiral spans about 20,000 light years and is seen through a field of foreground stars from our Milky Way Galaxy.  The center of NGC 6946 is home to a nuclear starburst itself, and picturesque dark dust is seen lacing the disk along with bright blue stars, red emission nebulas, fast moving gas clouds, and unusually frequent supernovas.  The 8-meter Gemini North Telescope in Hawaii, USA, took the above image.  A suggested explanation for the high star formation rate is the recent accretion of many primordial low-mass neutral hydrogen clouds from the surrounding region.",

    "explanation": "The new Delta IV Heavy Launch Vehicle is the largest rocket ever to be launched by the US Air Force.  The Delta IV Heavy is capable of launching over 23,000 kilograms into low Earth orbit.  The first launch of the Delta IV Heavy occurred last month and was largely successful with the exception that the boosters shut off several seconds prematurely.  Boeing's Delta IV Heavy is the largest of the Delta IV series, packing the punch of three rocket boosters instead of one.  Pictured above, the Delta IV Heavy is seen lifting off by a RocketCam perched on its side.  The time-lapse sequence shows the launch, one of the rocket boosters being jettisoned, and a test satellite further lifting away. Lockheed Martin is developing its own heavy lifting version of its Altas rocket series in conjunction with the US Air Force's Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) progam.",

    "explanation": "A nearly full Moon and planet Earth's shadow set together in this scene captured Monday from snowy Mt. Jelm, home of the Wyoming Infrared Observatory. For early morning risers (and late to bed astronomers), shadow set in the western sky is a daily apparition whose subtle beauty is often overlooked in favor of the more colorful eastern horizon. Extending through the dense atmosphere, Earth's setting shadow is seen in this picture as a dark blue band along the distant horizon, bounded above by a pinkish glow or antitwilight arch. Also known as the Belt of Venus, the arch's lovely color is due to backscattering of reddened light from the rising Sun. The setting Moon's light is also reddened by the long sight-line through the atmosphere and echoes the dawn sky's yellow-orange hues.",

    "explanation": "What do you call a group of black holes ... a flock, a brace, a swarm? Monitoring a region around the center of our Galaxy, astronomers have indeed found evidence for a surprisingly large number of variable x-ray sources - likely black holes or neutron stars in binary star systems - swarming around the Milky Way's own central supermassive black hole. Chandra Observatory combined x-ray image data from their monitoring program is shown above, with four variable sources circled and labeled A-D. While four sources may not make a swarm, these all lie within only three light-years of the central supermassive black hole known as Sgr A* (the bright source just above C). Their detection implies that a much larger concentration of black hole systems is present. Repeated gravitational interactions with other stars are thought to cause the black hole systems to spiral inward toward the Galactic Center region.",

    "explanation": "Gazing across this gorgeous skyscape, the Southern Cross and stars of the constellation Centaurus are seen above the outline of Mauna Loa (Long Mountain), planet Earth's largest volcano. Unfamiliar to sky gazers north of about 25 degrees north latitude, the Southern Cross, constellation Crux, is near the horizon to the left of Mauna Loa's summit. A compact constellation of bright stars, the long axis of the cross conveniently points south toward the southern celestial pole. The top of the cross is marked by the lovely pale red star Gamma Crucis, which is in fact a red giant star about 120 light-years distant. Stars of the grand constellation Centaurus almost engulf the Southern Cross with blue giant Beta Centauri, and yellowish Alpha Centauri, appearing as the brightest stars to the left of Gamma Crucis. At a distance of 4.3 light-years, Alpha Centauri, the closest star to the Sun, is actually a triple star system which includes a star similar to the Sun. But what caused the reddish streaks in the foreground of this time exposure? Alas, it is the mundane glow of lights from cars (not molten lava!) traveling the road to Hilo, Hawaii.",

    "explanation": "Is this image worth a thousand words?  According to the Holographic Principle, the most information you can get from this image is about 3 x 1065 bits for a normal sized computer monitor.  The Holographic Principle, yet unproven, states that there is a maximum amount of information content held by regions adjacent to any surface.  Therefore, counter-intuitively, the information content inside a room depends not on the volume of the room but on the area of the bounding walls.  The principle derives from the idea that the  Planck length, the length scale where quantum mechanics begins to dominate  classical gravity, is one side of an area that can hold only about one bit of information.  The limit was first postulated by physicist Gerard 't Hooft in 1993.  It can arise from generalizations from seemingly distant speculation that the information held by a black hole is determined not by its enclosed volume but by the surface area of its  event horizon.  The term \"holographic\" arises from a hologram analogy where three-dimension images are created by projecting light through a flat screen.  Beware, other people looking at the above image may not claim to see 3 x 1065 bits -- they might claim to see a teapot.",

    "explanation": "One might guess that the group of stars on the left is responsible for shaping the gas cloud on the right -- but it probably is not. Observations of many of the stars in the NGC 2467 show them to be more a superposition of loose groups of stars at different distances than a coherent open cluster of stars energizing the nebula.  Still, the above image captures various stages of star formation.  The stars at the far left have already formed and their birth nebulae have already dispersed.  At the lower left lies a very young star that is breaking free of its surrounding birth cocoon of gas.  On the right of the above image, a bright wall of bright gas glows as it evaporates from the energy of many newly formed bright stars.  Toward the center, deep dark lanes of dust hide parts of the nebula that surely are forming new stars.  The 8-meter Gemini South Telescope, perched on a mountaintop in Cerro Pachon, Chile, took the above image.  NGC 2467 lies toward the southern constellation of Puppis, with many of the stars being about 17,000 light years distant.",

A strange ridge crosses the moon near the equator, visible near the bottom of the above image, making Iapetus appear similar to the pit of a peach.  Half of Iapetus is so dark that it can nearly disappear when viewed from Earth.  Recent observations show that the degree of darkness of the terrain is strangely uniform, like a dark coating was somehow recently applied to an ancient and highly cratered surface.  The other half of Iapetus is relatively bright but oddly covered with long and thin streaks of dark.  A 400-kilometer wide impact basin is visible near the image center, delineated by deep scarps that drop sharply to the crater floor.  The above image was taken by the Saturn-orbiting Cassini spacecraft during a flyby of Iapetus at the end of last year.",
